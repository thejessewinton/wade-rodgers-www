Wadeâ€™s interest in art and his creative drive stems from being part
of a dance company as a child, where he first experienced the power
of storytelling through music and movement. Gifted a film camera by
a family friend, his photographic eye began to develop.
</p>

<p>
He attended Columbia College Chicago and focused in Cinematography.
For over a decade, he worked in and led camera and lighting
departments on feature films, commercials, documentaries, TV shows,
etc.
</p>

<p>
Along the way, he discovered his passion for writing and directing.
His background in dance and cinematography make him a visually
forward director with a keen sense of rhythm. He also continues to
focus on still photography. With a genuine love of travel, he works
between Los Angeles and Chicago or wherever the inspiration takes
him.
