            Wadeâ€™s interest in art and his creative drive stems from being part
            of a dance company as a child, where he first experienced the power
            of storytelling through music and movement. Gifted a film camera by
            a family friend, his photographic eye began to develop.
          </p>

            He attended Columbia College Chicago and focused in Cinematography.
            For over a decade, he worked in and led camera and lighting
            departments on feature films, commercials, documentaries, TV shows,
            etc.
          </p>

          <p>
            Along the way, he discovered his passion for writing and directing.
            His background in dance and cinematography make him a visually
            forward director with a keen sense of rhythm. He also continues to
            focus on still photography. With a genuine love of travel, he works
            between Los Angeles and Chicago or wherever the inspiration takes
            him.
